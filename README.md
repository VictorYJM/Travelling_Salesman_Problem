## Description  
The Pickup and Delivery Traveling Salesman Problem (PDTSP) is an extension of the classic TSP that introduces a more complex logistical dynamic: each task involves two distinct points—a pickup location and a delivery destination. The salesman must start from a depot and fulfill a set of requests where items need to be collected at specific locations and delivered to particular destinations.

A key characteristic of this problem is the precedence constraint, meaning no item can be delivered before it is picked up. Each point on the map is visited exactly once as a pickup location and once as a delivery location.

The main objective is to compare two metaheuristics by analyzing Time-To-Target (TTT) graphs, aiming to find the best possible solution considering the time required to reach it.

## Algorithms used  
* **BRKGA (Biased Random Key Genetic Algorithm):**  
  - A genetic algorithm that represents solutions as vectors of real numbers between 0 and 1 (random keys).  
  - Each vector is decoded into a valid route, ensuring pickups occur before deliveries.  
  - The population consists of:  
    - *Elite* — the best solutions preserved across generations  
    - *Mutants* — entirely new random solutions to maintain diversity  
    - *Offspring* — generated by crossover between elite and non-elite individuals, inheriting genes partially  
  - The evolutionary process continues for several generations, aiming to minimize the total route cost.

* **Simulated Annealing (SA):**  
  - An optimization method inspired by the thermal annealing process, which controls temperature to escape local minima.  
  - Starts with a random valid solution, respecting that pickups must precede deliveries.  
  - In each iteration, generates a neighboring solution by randomly swapping two cities in the route.  
  - Worse solutions may be accepted with a probability depending on the current temperature—helping avoid being trapped in suboptimal solutions.  
  - The temperature gradually decreases until reaching a minimum threshold, making the search stricter over time.  
  - The algorithm terminates after a maximum number of cycles or when the temperature hits the minimum, returning the best solution found.

## Results  
After analyzing the Time-To-Target (TTT) graphs generated from algorithm executions on different problem instances, it was observed that Simulated Annealing (SA) outperformed BRKGA.

SA not only reached solutions faster in most instances but also showed greater consistency, maintaining low variation between runs.

These results indicate that, for the tested dataset, SA is more efficient and reliable in solving the PDTSP, making it especially advantageous when computational time is limited.
